README for Pose Estimation and Exercise Tracking Program

Description

This program utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to perform pose estimation and track various exercises such as curls, push-ups, jumping jacks, sit-ups, skipping rope, boxing, and planking. The application captures video from a webcam, processes the images to detect human body landmarks, and then calculates angles and movements to count repetitions and track exercise stages.

Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
MediaPipe library
NumPy library
Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy
Usage

Start the Program: Run the script to start the pose estimation and exercise tracking program. The webcam will be activated and display a live video feed.
Perform Exercises: Perform exercises in front of the camera. The program currently supports the following exercises:
Arm curls
Push-ups
Jumping jacks
Sit-ups
Skipping rope
Boxing punches
Plank
View Real-time Feedback: The application will display the live video feed with pose landmarks. It will also show real-time information such as exercise count and stages (e.g., 'up' or 'down' for push-ups).
Exit the Program: Press 'q' to quit the program at any time.
Features

Real-time Pose Estimation: Uses MediaPipe's pose estimation to detect and track body landmarks.
Exercise Tracking: Tracks various exercises and counts repetitions.
Real-time Display: Shows a live feed with pose landmarks and exercise-related information.
Customizable Parameters: Parameters for detection confidence and tracking can be adjusted in the code.
Limitations

The accuracy of exercise tracking may vary based on lighting conditions and camera quality.
The program is designed for a single user in the frame.
Some exercises may require specific angles or positions relative to the camera for accurate tracking.
Contributing

Contributions to improve the program or add more features are welcome. Please ensure to follow coding standards and add comments for clarity.
